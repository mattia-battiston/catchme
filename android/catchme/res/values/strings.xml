        I will never forget the first time I saw you. I was doing my museum walk, going around the room and pretending to be interested in those old radios, when I saw you standing in a corner, 
        looking at some electonic stuff. \n
        You were wearing your short black jacket, and brown trousers. I remember I thought \"wow, she\'s so beautiful! I wander who she is. Maybe Antonia knows her 
        and can introduce me to her\". \n\n
        And then we went to that bar with crappy karaoke, I had an hot chocolate and you had a coke. But really you wanted an hot chocolate too :-) 
        Then we exchanged numbers, Andreas. Then there was the Tibet night. And the rest is history...

        I couldn\'t stop listening to you, I was already in love :-) ah ah, and then you were too shy to give me a small kiss to thank me for paying for the pizza. Awww, bless you.\n
        And then we walked, and walked, and walked...there was always an extra ultimo giro just to chat some more.

        We have so many memories here! She was definitely crazy, but thank God she was there and we met. \n

        5 minutes later...\"Emilyyyyyyyyyy, what have I done?!?!\". Luckily I sent you that message, you made up your mind and came back to me.

        but you said \"uh, holding hands, nice\" and so we did...but hey, nevermind, that was cool :-) \n
        then we walked and I brought you here, at the Torre dei Lamberti, right at the top; 
        I showed you where I lived, and that was the moment when you realized I didn\'t live near San Zeno. You understood I really cared about you, I was willing to walk all that way just for you! \n
        So you hugged me, and that was the moment I kissed you, just before telling you how beautiful you are and how much I liked you. \n
